# Pedestrian_Simulation

## PSO-CA model
This program was finished (not completely) in the winter holiday of 2019. I mainly used particle swarm optimization (PSO) and celluler automation (CA) theorem to modeling the pedestrian movement in the Louvre. There's some irrationality but fortunately the simulation of a simple evacuation could be run. You may need to start at level_b2.m which was the code for the second base level for the Louvre.

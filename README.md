# Pedestrian_Simulation
A continuesly updating page for pedestrian modeling using different models
## PSO-CA model
This pprogram was finished (not sufficiantly) in the winter holiday of 2019. I mainly used PSO, which is particle swarm optimization and celluler automation theorem to modeling the pedestrian movement in the Louvre. There's mountains of irrationality but fortunately we can successfully simulate a simple evacuation situation inside the Louvre. And it's quite hard to read my codes since everything is such messy. You may need to start at e.g. level_b2.m etc.
